# Healthcare Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of disease using patient health parameters
through a Machine Learning model.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression

## Current Progress
Review-2 completed (Initial ML model implementation)

## Execution Steps
1. Install required libraries
2. Run disease_prediction.py

## Future Scope
- Improve dataset size
- Apply advanced ML algorithms
- Integrate with healthcare applications

## Review-2 Status
✔ Initial dataset creation  
✔ Data preprocessing  
✔ Logistic Regression model implementation  
✔ Model evaluation using accuracy  


## Review-3 Progress
- Expanded dataset to more than 1000 records
- Implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest models
- Compared performance of multiple ML algorithms
